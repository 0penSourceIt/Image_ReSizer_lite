## How it Works: 

### Compression Page:
- You can select Single image or multiple (Batch Images).
- You can input Desire Size either in KB or MB. 
- Can compress into either JPG/JPEG or PDF (whichever you select).
- There are certain modes you can consider.
- Select the format JPG/PDF?
- Compress and your output with location will be displayed into Preview-Card
- Same Goes for **Conversion Page**

## 🛠️ Key Features (Lite Edition)

### ⚡ Smart Compression Engine
- **Binary Search Quality:** Finds the optimal quality percentage to hit your specific target size.
- **Privacy First:** All processing happens locally on your device. No images are uploaded to any server.
- **Iterative Scaling:** Automatically adjusts dimensions to ensure target sizes are met without crashing.
